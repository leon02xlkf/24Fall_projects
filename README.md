In this game, each player has 3 different stages that should be taken by order in each turn.

The stages are below:

1. a player will get 2 card when it is his turn.
2. The player will decide which card will he use. The card kill(do damage to other players) will only be allowed to used once a turn without some special equipment. There are no limitation for other cards.
3. If the number of the card for this player is greater than his health, then he must drop n cards(n = current containing card - health). 
For example, if a player has 4 cards and he only gets 2 health, then 2 cards should be dropped.

The type of cards are below:
1. basic cards:
kill, defend, heal
2. equipment cards: this type of cards can change the number of damage and health of the player
3. skill cards: this type of cards has special skills.
